## Introduction

Here we will predict the quality of wine on the basis of given features. We use the wine quality dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset has the fundamental features which are responsible for affecting the quality of the wine. By the use of Machine learning model, we will predict the quality of the wine.

## Machine Learning Model

Steps Involved are:
- Data Cleaning
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Data
- Applying the Random Forest Classifier Algorithm
- Evaluating the Model
- Accuracy Obtained is 76%
